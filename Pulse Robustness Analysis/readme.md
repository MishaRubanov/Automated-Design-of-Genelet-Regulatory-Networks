## Pulse robustness
### The question we tried to answer is: how can we discover a robust incoherent feed-forward loop pulse (i.e. a pulse that is not sensitive to external factors such as experimental noise, such as concentration variation or enzyme catalytic efficiency differences.
* We discovered that given the uncertainty in the rate kinetic parameters, it would be quite difficult to quantify robustness, both in optimization of a model and experimentally.
